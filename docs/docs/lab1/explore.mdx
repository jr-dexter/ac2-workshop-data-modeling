## Query the data via the REST API

Since our 4 models are currently independant, we should technically look at 4 JSON Schemas but in the context of this lab, the application exposes a single JSON Schema file regrouping all 4 objects

The schema of the REST API defined using OpenAPI is leveraging JSON Schema to define the format of the payload returned by the different endpoint.
While an OpenAPI file is not a JSON Schema it can be interesting to take a look

## Explore the GraphQL Schema

Usually the easier way to explore the schema of a GraphQL application is to use the GraphQL Sandbox.
The sample application also exposes the GraphQL Schema via its own endpoint, in GraphQL native schema format.
