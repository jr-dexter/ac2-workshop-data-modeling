## Sample application

To save some time and focus on the most important part of the lab, a sample application providing exporing the same data in all 3 formats is available.

The internal model of the application is defined using Pydantic
- On one side, the data is available using a REST api provided by Pydantic
- On the other side, the data is available via GraphQL interface
