## Load some data into the application

Before taking a closer look at the different schemas, we're gonna load some data into the application to make it a bit more interesting.

:::info
The application must be running on port 8000 while running the next command so it's important to keep the application running on one terminal and to start a new one to execute the command below
:::

```shell
invoke lab1-start --reload
```

## Query the data via the REST API

<ReferenceLink title="List all devices in the REST API" url="http://localhost:8000/api/devices/" openInNewTab />

## Query the data via the GraphQL API

<ReferenceLink title="GraphQL Sandbox" url="http://localhost:8000/graphql" openInNewTab />

```graphql
query {
  devices {
    name
    site {
      name
    }
  }
}
```
