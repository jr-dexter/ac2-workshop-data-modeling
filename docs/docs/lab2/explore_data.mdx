## Exploring the data

### Exploring the data in SQLite

Open the database in either [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/) or [SQLite viewer plugin for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=qwtel.sqlite-viewer&ssr=false#overview)

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="DBBrowser for SQLite" default>

Launch **DB Browser for SQLite**

Open the **database.db** file in the project directory.

Click on the **Browse Data** tab and select the **devicemodel** table.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="VSCode - SQLite Browser">

Double click the **database.db** file within VSCode.

Expand the **devicemodel** to view the data.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Each device is represented as a row in the **devicemodel** table.

The **site_id** column of each row references the ID of a row in the **sitemodel** table. This models a one to many relationship otherwise known as a **ForeignKey** relationship.

### Exploring the data in the graph database (Neo4j)

Navigate to the [Neo4j Browser](http://localhost:7474). 

Click on the **database** icon in the top left.

![neo4j-menu](../images/lab2/02-neo4j-menu.png)

Click on the **Device** Node Label.

![neo4j-device-base](../images/lab2/06-neo4j-base-device-1.png)

There should be 5 device nodes displayed.

![neo4j-device-base](../images/lab2/07-neo4j-device-nodes.png)

Click one of the device nodes to see the properties of the node.

![neo4j-device-base](../images/lab2/neo4j-device-properties.png)

We can see that attributes of an instance of a **devicemodel** are stored as the properties of the node.

Click on the device node again and select the **relationships** icon.

![neo4j-device-base](../images/lab2/08-neo4j-device-relationships-1.png)

The node has a relationship to **site-1** with a label of **LOCATED_IN** that represents the type of the relationship. This relationship mimics a [Foreign Key](https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/qras0z/please_explain_foreign_keys_to_me_like_i_am_six/) relationship.

Currently, tags are a standalone model and do not have relationships with any other models. It may prove useful to allow multiple tags to be added to multiple devices.

The next steps will implement a [Many-to-Many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-to-many_(data_model)) relationship between tags and devices within both types of databases.

Time to get our hands on some code!

## (Neo4j) Adding many-to-many relationship between devices and tags

The first step will be to add a ``TagsMixin`` into **workshop_b2/lab2/database/models.py**.

At the top of the there is a ``def _build_filter_query`` method, add the following code below that function.

```python
class TagMixin:
    tags: list[Tag] = Field(default_factory=list)

    def add_tags(self, db: Driver, tags: list[Tag]):
        """Add tags to a node.

        Args:
            db (Driver): Neo4j driver instance.
            tags (list[Tag]): List of tags to add.
        """
        node_label = self.__class__.__name__.replace("Model", "").title()
        node_short = node_label[0]
        for tag in tags:
            query = (
                f"MATCH ({node_short}:{node_label}" + " {name: $name})"
                "OPTIONAL MATCH (t:Tag {name: " + f'"{tag.name}"' + "})"
                f"MERGE ({node_short})-[:TAGGED]->(t)"
            )
            db.execute_query(
                query, {"name": self.name, "tags": [t.model_dump() for t in tags]}
            )

```

Add the ``TagsMixin`` class to the ``DeviceModel``.

```python
class DeviceModel(Device, TagMixin):
```

Next, update the ``create`` method on the ``DeviceModel`` to add the tags if they exist.

```python
if self.tags:
    self.add_tags(db, self.tags)

# shown for placement purposes
return self.get(db)
```

Now navigate to **workshop_b2/models.py** and add the following line to the **Device** class.

```python
class Device(BaseModel):
    name: str
    manufacturer: str | None = None
    status: DeviceStatus = DeviceStatus.ACTIVE
    tags: list[Tag] = Field(default_factory=list)
```

Run the load command with the ``--tags`` option.

```shell
invoke lab2-load --tags
```

Navigate back to the local [Neo4j UI](http://localhost:7474).

Click on any of the tags and then click on the **relationship** icon.

![neo4j-tag-relationship-1](../images/lab2/12-neo4j-tag-relationship-1.png)

Click on the **relationship** icon for one of the devices tied to the selected tag.

![neo4j-tag-device-1](../images/lab2/13-neo4j-tag-device-1.png)

Now we can see that devices can have multiple tags and tags can have multiple devices.
