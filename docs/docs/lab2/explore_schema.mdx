## Exploring the schema in SQLite

Open the database in either [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/) or [SQLite viewer plugin for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=qwtel.sqlite-viewer&ssr=false#overview)


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="DBBrowser for SQLite" default>

Launch **DB Browser for SQLite**

Open the **database.db** file in the project directory.

![sqlite-schema](../images/lab2/sqlite-schema.png)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="VSCode - SQLite Browser">

Double click the **database.db** file within VSCode.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

There is a table for each model defined in the application.

Expand the **devicemodel** table. We can see that there is a column for each attribute defined in the model.

Each column has a specific type associated with it. The relationships are also modeled as a column and links to a key in another table as an **INTEGER**. For example, the **site_id** column references rows in the **sitemodel** table.

## Exploring the schema in the graph database (Neo4j)

Navigate to the [Neo4j Browser](http://localhost:7474). 

Click on the **database** icon in the top left.

In a graph database, we do not have tables that represent each model, but instead we will have nodes that use a **node label** to define their **"model"**.

There are node labels that correlate to each model, but there is no underlying schema stored in the database.

![neo4j-node-labels](../images/lab2/03-neo4j-node-labels.png)

The attributes of models will be stored as properties of the node in the database, but there is no enforcement of which properties a node should have or what type they should be.

The enforcement of properties and their types must be done at the application layer.

Relationships between nodes are created as **edges** and they will also have their **labels** associated with them.
